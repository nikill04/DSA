UNDIRECTED GRAPH : a particular connection b/w two nodes represents bidirectional. 
DIRECTED GRAPH : A -> B, represents connection from A to B but not from B to A.

1) COMPLETE GRAPH : There should be no disconnected component or node. In one way or another, all nodes need to be connected or present as a single entity

2) DISCONNECTED GRAPH(FOREST TYPE) : That means, whole graph is not single entity. We can say that whole graph is two or more separate graphs.

3) 
    1. CYCLIC GRAPH : Graph containing atleast one cycle.
    2. ACYCLIC GRAPH : Graph which don't contain any cycles.

4) EULER GRAPH : Degree of each node is even. (Degree of a node is no. of edges or no. of connections arising from that node)

5) HAMILTONIAN GRAPH : We start from a node, and if we are able to reach that node again and this should be possible for all nodes in the graph. Then it is a hamiltonian graph.

for the above graph, the adjacency matrix will be

       1    2    3    4


1      0    1    1    0

2      1    0    1    1

3      1    1    0    1

4      0    1    1    0
    
-> For a undirected graph, the adjacency matrix will be a symmetric matrix.

For the same graph, the adjacency list will be
1 => {2, 3}
2 => {1, 4, 3}
3 => {1, 2, 4}
4 => {2, 3}
