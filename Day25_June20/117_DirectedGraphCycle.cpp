/* DETECT CYCLE IN A DIRECTED GRAPH : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph/1

Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.
The graph is represented as a 2D vector edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes an edge from verticex u to v.

Examples:

Input: V = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]]



Output: true
Explanation: The diagram clearly shows a cycle 0 → 1 → 2 → 0
Input: V = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3]]


Output: false
Explanation: no cycle in the graph
Constraints:
1 ≤ V ≤ 105
0 ≤ E ≤ 105
0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V                           */
