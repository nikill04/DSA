/* LONGEST REPEATING SUBSEQUENCE : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-repeating-subsequence2004/1

Given string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string.

The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string s if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B. For example, A = "xax" and B = "xax" then the index of the first "x" must be different in the original string for A and B.

Examples :

Input: s = "axxzxy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The given array with indexes looks like
a x x z x y 
0 1 2 3 4 5
The longest subsequence is "xx". It appears twice as explained below.
subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of s
subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 4  <-- index of s
We are able to use character 'x' (at index 2 in s) in both subsequences as it appears on index 1 in subsequence A and index 0 in subsequence B.
Input: s = "axxxy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The given array with indexes looks like
a x x x y 
0 1 2 3 4
The longest subsequence is "xx". It appears twice as explained below.
subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of s
subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 3  <-- index of s
We are able to use character 'x' (at index 2 in s) in both subsequencesas it appears on index 1 in subsequence A and index 0 in subsequence B.
Constraints:
1 <= s.size() <= 103                               */
