/* LONGEST REPEATING SUBSEQUENCE : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-repeating-subsequence2004/1

Given string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string.

The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string s if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B. For example, A = "xax" and B = "xax" then the index of the first "x" must be different in the original string for A and B.

Examples :

Input: s = "axxzxy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The given array with indexes looks like
a x x z x y 
0 1 2 3 4 5
The longest subsequence is "xx". It appears twice as explained below.
subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of s
subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 4  <-- index of s
We are able to use character 'x' (at index 2 in s) in both subsequences as it appears on index 1 in subsequence A and index 0 in subsequence B.
Input: s = "axxxy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The given array with indexes looks like
a x x x y 
0 1 2 3 4
The longest subsequence is "xx". It appears twice as explained below.
subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of s
subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 3  <-- index of s
We are able to use character 'x' (at index 2 in s) in both subsequencesas it appears on index 1 in subsequence A and index 0 in subsequence B.
Constraints:
1 <= s.size() <= 103                               */




/* 
Here, Longest repeating subsequence is exactly same as Longest common subsequence, just here we take another string same as the first string, and as here we need to find longest common subsequence (as we need not consider the subsequence which is repeating most no. of times, we should just consider the longest one, just even enough it repeats for 2 times, that's it is same as LCS) such that the considered common character should not be exactly same i.e., index of the same character in both the strings should be different, remaining logic is exactly same that's why we just add "&& i != j"
