TOPOLOGICAL SORTING :

Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices of a graph such that: 
If there is an edge u → v, then u comes before v in the order.

Where it applies : Only for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) 
If a cycle exists → topological order is impossible(Because ordering which one's first is not possible, same problem with undirected graphs).

Why it’s used : To handle dependencies, for example:
1. Course prerequisites
2. Build/compile order
3. Task scheduling

Key idea (in one line) : Do tasks only after all tasks they depend on are done.
